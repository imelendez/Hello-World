      <h2>Problem Statement & Description</h2>
      In order to support efforts of government to become more transparent and increase access to information. Currently online access to health reports is not available online, access would make restaurants more accountable to patrons. I will make an web application that facilitates access by the public to current status/report of their favorite restaurants. In addition I will make a simple android app that can demonstrate how the Hidalgo Health department could utilize technology to collect reports quicker and more efficiently from employees out in the field via a android tablet or phone. This a very practical approach with real-life implementation.

      <h2>Project Goals and Objectives/Deliverables</h2>
      Mobile/Tablet Interface (updates databases with new information)
      Tablet application needs to provide an interface for employees of the County Health Department will be able to input their daily reports.
      must include timestamp
      updates by text only
      images (will be attempt)
      possibly geolocation at time of input
      Web Application need to provide a public interface for the public to be able to search and view reports.
      searchable
      fast
      displays inspection results easily
      includes address
      mobile friendly
      no login in will be required to view information
      Code
      Code utilized will be shared on personal github

      
      <h2>Project Scope</h2>
      Languages (Python, HTML, CSS, JSON, AJAX)
      Framework: Django (python)
      AWS
      A mobile or tablet (Android) interface for workers to be able to input their own daily reports
      A database technology will be chosen that most efficiently allows interaction with web and mobile.
      EXTRA (web) features: The following are beyond the scope of the project and time limitations but will be considered.
      Opportunity to improve is adding a social media or other  interactive feature that will increase engagement with website
      Ratings (Will have to login)
      Recommendations (Will have to login)
      Messenger bot (answer questions)

      <h2>Success Factors and Benefits</h2>
      This project will increase information access by community and make government more open. Though it production I will be able to learn how to develop a more complete system that allows mobile and web to work together through a shared database.  I will learn to make an android app. Explore/research cloud services (AWS).
