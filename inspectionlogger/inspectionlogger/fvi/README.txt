In order to support efforts of government to become more transparent and increase access to information. Currently online access to health reports is not available online, access would make restaurants more accountable to patrons. 
I will make an web application that facilitates access by the public to current status/report of their favorite restaurants. In addition I will make a simple android app that can demonstrate how the Hidalgo Health department could utilize technology to collect reports quicker and more efficiently from employees out in the field via a android tablet or phone. 
This a very practical approach with real-life implementation.
